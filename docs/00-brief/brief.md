## Executive Summary

AeroSense is a passenger-focused aviation intelligence mobile application that provides real-time flight tracking, predictive delay alerts, instant gate change notifications, and smart journey management. By aggregating data from multiple aviation sources and applying predictive analytics, AeroSense transforms the reactive, fragmented air travel experience into a proactive, unified journey companion.

**The Problem**: Air travel remains stressful due to unpredictable disruptions, fragmented information sources, and lack of timely communication. Passengers discover gate changes, delays, and connection risks too late to adjust their plans, resulting in missed flights, wasted time, and significant anxiety.

**Target Market**: Primary focus on business travelers and frequent flyers who fly 3+ times per month, secondary focus on leisure travelers and connector passengers with tight layovers.

**Value Proposition**: AeroSense is the only flight tracking app that **predicts disruptions before they're officially announced** and delivers **personalized, actionable notifications** that help passengers take control of their journey. Unlike reactive apps that merely report current status, AeroSense's intelligent alerts give passengers the time they need to make informed decisions.
